# Incident-Response-Playbooks

SOC analysts are typically inundated with security alerts and incidents on a regular basis, at volumes so large that available personnel are overwhelmed. This results all too often in situations where many alerts are ignored and many incidents aren't investigated, leaving the organization vulnerable to attacks that go unnoticed.

Many, if not most, of these alerts and incidents conform to recurring patterns that can be addressed by specific and defined sets of remediation actions. Analysts are also tasked with basic remediation and investigation of the incidents they do manage to address. To the extent that these activities can be automated, a SOC can be that much more productive and efficient, allowing analysts to devote more time and energy to investigative activity.

A playbook is a collection of these remediation actions that you run from Microsoft Sentinel as a routine, to help automate and orchestrate your threat response. It can be run in two ways:

    Manually on-demand, on a particular entity or alert
    Automatically in response to specific alerts or incidents, when triggered by an automation rule.
